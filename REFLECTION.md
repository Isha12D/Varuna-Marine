# Reflection on AI Agent Usage

During the development of the FuelEU Maritime compliance dashboard, I leveraged several AI agents to accelerate coding and improve code quality.

## Key Learnings
- AI agents like Copilot and Claude Code are highly effective for generating boilerplate and refactoring repetitive code.
- Proper prompts and iterative refinement are crucial; initial AI outputs often need manual validation.
- Using Cursor Agent helped structure tasks and ensured all endpoints and components were accounted for.

## Efficiency Gains
- Copilot reduced the time to write TypeScript components and Prisma schemas by ~40%.
- Claude Code helped identify and refactor inefficient or unsafe backend patterns.
- Overall, AI agents allowed me to focus more on domain logic and less on repetitive syntax or setup.

## Improvements for Next Time
- Integrate automated testing earlier to catch AI-generated bugs immediately.
- Combine agent outputs with strict type validation for better safety.
- Maintain a more detailed log of prompts and outputs for audit and reproducibility.
